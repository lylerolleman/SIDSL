# SIDSL
Simple Imperative Domain Specific Language

As the name implies, this is a simple DSL to be used as a base for further tinkering 
in language design and optimization. 

It is interpreted, with weak static typing to mirror the type system of JSON. 
Further documentation can be found in the Documentation file


It is designed for personal research purposes and not for general usability.
